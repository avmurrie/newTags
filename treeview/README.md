React TreeView Recursive Example
==================================


Can be the React component recursive? Why not, after all it's JavaScript function. This repo contains a sample of Recursive TreeView Component.

There is well known [example](https://github.com/chenglou/react-treeview) of Tree View made by [chenglou](https://github.com/chenglou). It works quite good, but only if you know the level of your tree in advance. 

This example on the other hand can handle the data more dynamically.  Check the [demo with two examples](http://jirivrany.github.io/react-treeview-recursive/).

If you want to test it, simply clone the repo.

Updated to React 16.x with great inspiration and help from [Create React App tool](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Run:  
```
npm install
npm start
```

Check your http://localhost:3000/ and then put your data to the scripts/mockData.js.
